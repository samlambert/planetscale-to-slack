# Database Optimization: Add Index on comments.post_id

## üéØ Purpose
This pull request implements a database performance optimization recommended by **PlanetScale**. Adding an index on the `post_id` column in the `comments` table will significantly improve query performance for comment-related operations.

## üìä Performance Impact

### Expected Benefits
- **üöÄ Faster queries**: Queries filtering by `post_id` will see significant performance improvements
- **‚ö° Improved JOINs**: JOIN operations between posts and comments will be optimized
- **üìà Better query planning**: Database optimizer can make more efficient execution plans

### Query Patterns That Will Benefit
```sql
-- Get all comments for a specific post
SELECT * FROM comments WHERE post_id = ?;

-- Count comments per post  
SELECT post_id, COUNT(*) FROM comments GROUP BY post_id;

-- JOIN posts with their comments
SELECT p.*, c.* FROM posts p 
LEFT JOIN comments c ON p.id = c.post_id 
WHERE p.id = ?;
```

## üîß Implementation Details

**DDL Statement**: 
```sql
ALTER TABLE `planetscale`.`comments` ADD INDEX `idx_comments_on_post_id` (`post_id`);
```

**Index Details**:
- Table: `comments`
- Column: `post_id`
- Index Name: `idx_comments_on_post_id`
- Type: Non-clustered index

## üìÅ Migration Examples Included

This PR provides comprehensive migration examples for popular frameworks:

- **Rails/ActiveRecord**: Migration file with proper `add_index` usage
- **Django**: Both migration file and model Meta class examples
- **Prisma**: Schema definition with index declaration
- **TypeORM**: Migration file and entity decorator examples
- **Sequelize**: Migration and model definition with index
- **Raw SQL**: Direct DDL statements for database execution

## ‚úÖ Deployment Checklist

A comprehensive deployment checklist is included (`migrations/deployment-checklist.md`) covering:

- [ ] Pre-deployment verification steps
- [ ] Safe deployment procedures for PlanetScale and traditional MySQL
- [ ] Post-deployment monitoring and verification
- [ ] Rollback procedures if needed
- [ ] Success criteria measurement

## üìã Testing Recommendations

### Pre-deployment Testing
1. **Query Analysis**: Verify target queries will use the new index
2. **Performance Baseline**: Measure current query execution times
3. **Table Size Assessment**: Check table size to estimate index creation time

### Post-deployment Verification
```sql
-- Verify index exists
SHOW INDEX FROM comments WHERE Key_name = 'idx_comments_on_post_id';

-- Test query execution plan
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM comments WHERE post_id = 123;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations

### Minimal Impact Expected
- **Write Performance**: Small overhead on INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
- **Storage**: Additional 5-10% storage for the index
- **Index Maintenance**: Automatically handled by the database

### Rollback Plan
If performance issues occur, the index can be safely removed:
```sql
ALTER TABLE comments DROP INDEX idx_comments_on_post_id;
```

## üîç Review Focus Areas

Please review:
1. **Migration approach**: Ensure the chosen migration method fits your framework
2. **Index naming**: Verify `idx_comments_on_post_id` follows your naming conventions
3. **Deployment timing**: Plan deployment during low-traffic periods if needed
4. **Monitoring setup**: Ensure adequate monitoring is in place
